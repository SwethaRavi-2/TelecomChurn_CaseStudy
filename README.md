# TelecomChurn_CaseStudy

## Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences
an average of 15 25 annual churn rate Given the fact that it costs 5 10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than
customer acquisition Hence, it is vital for us to understand which customers may churn so that the retention strategies can be devised accordingly.

## Business Objective

In this project, our business objective is to analyze customer level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of
churn. Thus, our focus would be on 
(i) Retaining high profitable.
(ii) Predicting which customers are at high risk of churn (in order to devise customer retention strategies accordingly).
